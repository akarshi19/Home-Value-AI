# Home Value AI

Welcome to **Home Value AI**, a project that predicts the price of houses based on key features such as location, number of bedrooms (BHK), square footage, and number of bathrooms. This project uses a **Linear Regression Model** built with Python and integrates it with a web interface using Flask. The website's frontend is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Features
- Predict house prices with high accuracy based on user input.
- Interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- Lightweight and scalable architecture.

## Architecture
#![R]()
The architecture of the project is as follows:

### 1. **ML Model**
- **Input:** Raw data.
- **Pipeline:**
  1. Data Cleaning: Preprocess raw data to remove noise and prepare datasets.
  2. Dataset Preparation: Splits data into training and testing sets.
  3. Training: Train a Linear Regression model on the dataset.
  4. Testing: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset.
  5. Build Model: Finalize the model for predictions.
  6. Prediction: Use the model to predict house prices.

### 2. **Flask Layer**
- Acts as the middle layer between the ML model and the website.
- Handles requests from the website and communicates with the ML model.
- Returns predictions to the website.

### 3. **Website**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interaction.
- Sends user inputs (location, BHK, square feet, bathrooms) to the Flask layer.
- Displays the predicted house price based on the ML model’s response.

**Diagram Overview:**
- Data flows from the website to the Flask layer as requests.
- Flask sends these inputs to the ML model.
- ML model processes the data and returns predictions back to the Flask layer.
- Flask layer sends the predictions to the website to display to the user.

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd home-value-ai
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Location**: Enter the city or area.
   - **BHK**: Enter the number of bedrooms.
   - **Square Feet**: Enter the total square footage.
   - **Bathrooms**: Enter the number of bathrooms.
3. Click on the "Predict" button.
4. View the predicted price of the house.
